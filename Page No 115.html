<p><i><h4> Guidelines toward optimized ensemble construction </h4></i></p> 
<p>     In this section, we use MEE to examine ensemble characteristics and provide some<br/>
guidelines for building optimal ensembles. We expect that by optimizing the ensemble<br/>
construction process, MEE will in general achieve comparable accuracy to other methods<br/>
using fewer individuals. We use data collected from the first fold of the first cross<br/>
validation routine for the following analyses</P>
<p>     We first investigate whether the ensemble size is positively related with the predictive<br/>
accuracy. It has been well established that, to a certain degree, the predictive accuracy of an<br/>
ensemble improves as the number of classifiers in the ensemble increases. For example, our<br/>
result in Figure 12 indicates that accuracy improvements flatten out at an ensemble size of<br/>
approximately 15-25. We also investigate whether the diversity among classifiers is<br/>
positively related with the ensemble’s classification performance. In our experiments, we<br/>
measured the diversity based on the difference of predicted class between each classifier and<br/>
the ensemble. We first define a new operator ⊕ as follows: α ⊕ β = 0 if α = β, 1 otherwise.<br/>
When an ensemble e consists of g classifiers, the diversity of ensemble e, diversitye<br/>
, is defined as follows:</p>

<p>    where <i>N</i> is the number of records in the test data and <i>pred<sub>j</sub><sup>i</sup></i><br/>
 and <i>pred<sub>j</sub><sup>e</sup></i> represent the<br/>
predicted class label for record <i>j</i> by classifier <i>i</i> and ensemble <i>e</i> respectively. The larger<br/>
the value of diversity<sup>e</sup><br/>
, the more diverse the ensemble is</p>
<p>    We show the relationship between the predictive accuracy and ensemble diversity<br/>
in Figure 12. This shows the expected positive relationship between accuracy and<br/>
diversity. However, our results show that too much diversity among classifiers can<br/>
deteriorate ensemble performance, as the final decision made by ensemble becomes a<br/>
random guess</p>
