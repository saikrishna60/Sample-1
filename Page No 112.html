<p><i>Figure 11: Graphical depiction of energy allocation in the MEE. Individual classifiers<br/>
(small boxes in the environment) receive energy by correctly classifying test points.<br/>
Energy for each ensemble is replenished between generations based on the accuracy<br/>
of the ensemble. Ensembles with higher accuracy have their energy bins replenished<br/>
with more energy per classifier, as indicated by the varying widths of the bins.</i></p>
